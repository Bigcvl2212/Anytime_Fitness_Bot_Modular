In the event that I sustain a medical injury that is not permanent, but renders my ability to train (i.e a broken leg), I will provide written documentation from my physician to receive a medical freeze on payment for my sessions.

Example: if you provide doctors written documentation that you need to freeze for 6 weeks, your original contract end date will now be extended by 6 weeks to make up and equal to the time frozen.</p><p>16.
