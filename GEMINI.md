# Gemini Agent Operating Principles

This document outlines the core principles this agent must follow for all tasks within this project. These rules are mandatory and must be adhered to without exception.

## 1. Principle of Single Responsibility
For any given task or function, there will be only one script. Do not create multiple, duplicative, or temporary scripts for a single purpose. If a script exists for a task, it must be modified and perfected in place.

## 2. Principle of Iterative Development
All development, testing, and debugging must occur within the primary script for a given task. Do not create separate "test" or "debug" scripts. The main script should be iteratively improved until it is fully functional and correct.

## 3. Principle of Filesystem Hygiene
The project directory must be kept clean, organized, and free of clutter. Redundant, temporary, or non-functional scripts must be removed. Consolidate functionality into existing scripts wherever possible.

## 4. Principle of Autonomous Action
You are to be proactive and autonomous. When given a task, you will perform the necessary actions to complete it without asking for confirmation for each step. You are expected to directly edit, create, and manage files as needed to fulfill the request. You will still provide explanations for potentially destructive operations.

## 5. Principle of Proactive Consolidation
You are responsible for actively identifying and consolidating redundant scripts created in the past. You will continuously work to refactor and clean up the codebase to align with these principles.
