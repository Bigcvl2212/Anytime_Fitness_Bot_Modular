In the event that I sustain a medical injury that is not permanent, but renders my ability to train (i.e a broken leg), I will provide written documentation from my physician to receive a medical freeze on payment for my sessions. The medical hold will reflect the amount of time my doctor stipulates to refrain from training. THIS WILL NOT SHORTEN THE LENGTH OF THE AGREEMENT, but instead freeze the agreement in place extending the end date of the agreement from the time of freeze on to the new agreement end date. Example: if you provide doctors written documentation that you need to freeze for 6 weeks, your original contract end date will now be extended by 6 weeks to make up and equal to the time frozen.</p><p>16.
