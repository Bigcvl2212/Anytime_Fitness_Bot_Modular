# YOUR CREDENTIALS NEEDED

I've fixed the code and database, but I need YOU to provide your real credentials.

## Edit the .env file and replace these placeholder values:

### ClubOS Credentials (REQUIRED for training clients):
```
CLUBOS_USERNAME=your_clubos_username_here  ← CHANGE THIS
CLUBOS_PASSWORD=your_clubos_password_here  ← CHANGE THIS
```

### Square Location ID (OPTIONAL - only if you use Square payments):
```
SQUARE_PRODUCTION_LOCATION_ID=your_square_location_id_here  ← CHANGE THIS
```

## After you update .env, restart the server:
```powershell
python run_dashboard.py
```

## What's Fixed:
✅ Python cache cleared
✅ Database schema fixed (prospect_id is now nullable)
✅ API type handling fixed (will load after restart)

## What Still Needs YOUR Input:
⚠️ ClubOS username and password (I can't guess these)
⚠️ Square location ID (optional, only if you use it)

The server is ready to start once you add the real ClubOS credentials to .env!
